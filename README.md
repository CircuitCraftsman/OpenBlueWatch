![OpenBlueWatch](https://github.com/CircuitCraftsman/OpenBlueWatch/blob/main/OpenBlueWatch/Schematic/Block%20Diagram.png)

Open-source smart watch design in Altium Designer. The smartwatch is based on Apollo4 blue plus SoC. It incorporates a pressure sensor, inertial measurement unit, magnetometer, temperature and humidity sensor, MEMS microphone, haptic driver, and Class D amplifier. In addition, power management is based on AXP173 PMIC. The device can be using JLINK adapter.

# Used Tools
- Altium Designer

    - Altium Designer (AD) is a printed circuit board (PCB) and electronic design automation software package for printed circuit boards. It was developed by the American software company Altium Limited. Altium Designer was formerly named under the brand Protel.

- Saturn PCB Toolkit

    - The Saturn PCB Toolkit is the best freeware resource for PCB-related calculations. It incorporates many features that PCB designers and engineers regularly need, like the current capacity of a PCB trace, via current, differential pairs, and much more.
